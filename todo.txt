TODO

-Errors raising as models become complex shows that the method should
 be reverse: from method 4 to method 1! Our data is like this

-Why not using regression? It seems that regression is a good idea f
 ro this as data is not huge and therefore traditional ML models
 should be good: write that we are interested in seeing modern ML
 methods like NN: put some motivation

-Plots: change scale or something that one can see differences; stop
 earlier: this is what plots show; there is kind of overfitting

--main file: Conclusion/Comparison the same as README?

--model 4: clean the url?

--?? M/F column can be integer: 0 and 1
