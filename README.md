# Neural Network Models for Age Prediction in Abalones

## Project Purpose
Predicting abalone's age, which is the number of rings on the shell.

This was the topic of a [Kaggle competition](www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e4/overview/$citation) using regression. However, we would like to design simple neural networks for this purpose. The reference to the competetion is

## Dataset
- Dataset at the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/1/abalone) with 
[doi.org/10.24432/C55C7W](doi.org/10.24432/C55C7W)
- Licence: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) 


## Requirements
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `figure` and `pyplot` from `matplotlib`
- `tensorflow`
- `keras`
  - Optimizer: `Adam`
  - Models: `InceptionV3`, `ResNet50`, `DenseNet`
- `sklearn`
  - Metrics: `MeanSquaredLogarithmicError`

## Utils Directory
The `utils` directory includes Python files, each of which contains a neural network model and possibly some variants of it. 

????? It also contains helper.py, which includes the following auxiliary functions:
- `datagen_train_dir`
- `datagen_test_dir`
- `plot_history`
- `plot_confusion_matrix`
- `plot_roc_au`

## Models Considered and Their Performance
**Model 1**: 
  - only with three dense layers
  - minimum validation Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (msle): 0.033
  - loss and  msle, as well as validation loss and validation msle are very close

**Model 2**:
  - only with dense layers of depth twice Model 1
  - minimum validation Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (msle): 0.034
  - loss and  msle, as well as validation loss and validation msle are very close

**Model 3**:
  - with dense layers of depth twice Model 1, with a dropout and a normalisation layer after each dense layer
  - minimum validation Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (msle): 0.06
  - loss and  msle, as well as validation loss and validation msle are very close

**Model 4**:
  - with more layers that Model 3, however, dense layers  have different and decreasing depth; it contains  dropout and normalisation layers but not the same order as Model 3
  - minimum validation Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (msle): 0.085
  - loss and  msle, as well as validation loss and validation msle are very close
